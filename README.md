# @vue/composition-api Benchmark Results

https://antfu.github.io/vue-composition-api-benchmark-results/

This is to host the benchmark result of [@vue/composition-api](https://github.com/vuejs/composition-api) compares to traditional Vue 2's option api and vue-next.

The benchmarks are forked from [krausest/js-framework-benchmark](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark) and you can check it in [this repo](https://github.com/antfu/js-framework-benchmark) and maybe run by yourself to verify.

I has made [a PR](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/pull/755) back to the original repo.
